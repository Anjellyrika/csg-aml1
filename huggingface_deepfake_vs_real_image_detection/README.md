We investigate a transformer model sourced from Hugging Face, *Deepfake vs Real Image Detection*.

**Hugging Face**: [Deepfake vs Real Image Detection](https://huggingface.co/dima806/deepfake_vs_real_image_detection) <br>
**Kaggle Notebook**: [Deepfake vs real faces detection ViT](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dima806/deepfake-vs-real-faces-detection-vit) <br>
**Author**: dima806 <br>

Please refer to the original notebook for detailed information on the model architecture and dataset preparation.

## Modifications
For our use of the model, some additional Python packages were installed. See the modified version [here](./HuggingFaceViT%20(Modified).ipynb).
