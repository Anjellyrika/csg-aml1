We investigate the model SeqFakeFormer, with the corresponding dataset Seq-Deepfake, as presented in the paper:

**Title**: Detecting and Recovering Sequential DeepFake Manipulation
**Authors**: Rui Shao, Tianxing Wu, and Ziwei Liu
**Published in**: [ECCV 2022](https://eccv2022.ecva.net/)
**Paper Link**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02204
**Original Repository**: [SeqDeepFake](https://github.com/rshaojimmy/SeqDeepFake/)
**Dataset**: [Seq-DeepFake](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rshaojimmy/Seq-DeepFake)

Please refer to the original paper for detailed information on the model architecture and dataset preparation.

## Modifications
For our use of the model, we used Python packages as specified in the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file.
