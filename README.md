## About the study
This repository contains the code and preliminary results of a study on the robustness of novel deepfake detection transformer models against adversarial attacks.

We investigate two models, [SeqFakeFormer](./seqdeepfake/) and [Deepfake vs real faces detection ViT](./huggingface_deepfake_vs_real_image_detection/).

### Adversarial Attacks
